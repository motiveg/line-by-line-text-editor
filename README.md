# line-by-line-text-editor

* Written in Python 3.
* Menuing and editing done in console.
* Append and delete to text files line by line.

* This program served as practiced for me to start programming, in Python, more than I would from doing practice problems online.
* Future changes would definitely include (at least): further organization, further simplification.
* Last update to program: July 4, 2017
